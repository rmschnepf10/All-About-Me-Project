  <p id="stitle">Sports</p>
  <p id="sparagraph">Ever since I was a little kid I was watching sports with my family.
    I would watch anything that was put in front of me. I also have played sports since I was
    in kindegarten. My favorite being soccer, which I played throughout my junior year.
    The best sports to watch (in my opinion) are soccer, football, and basketball. This year I
    am planning out doing pole valting for track. Sports have been and will always be a huge part of my life.
